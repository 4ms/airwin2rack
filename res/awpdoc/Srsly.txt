# Srsly is a psychoacoustic stereo processor.

People get really excited sometimes, so here’s a failure :)

Srsly is meant to do what a Hughes SRS processor does. That’s an obscure stereo widener actually made by Howard “Spruce Goose” Hughes’ company. I tackled it because a musician I love, Chad Clark, needs one ‘cos his is broken and not in proper working order. Hence, the need for somebody to try and do a plugin version. So I tried, with some pictures out of Popular Mechanics and a single cruddy youtube video to be my guide (this thing is OBSCURE) and I have not succeeded. Whatever the real one sounds like, this ain’t it.

But it does a thing, and I’ve added a Q control to help get it to do useful things since I can’t tell what’s right or wrong for this stuff, and this is as far as I can carry it right now. The source is MIT licensed for anyone else who’d like to pick up where I left off, and quite a bit of basic information is shown in the curves of that Popular Mechanics article about the thing, and it is kinda neat: accentuate comb-filtery effects you get from the shapes of your own ears. It does do a thing, that’s not like any other stereo effect I know of. And I ought to be able to use some of the tech from this to do subtle stereo-field enhancements in future versions of Console, stuff like that. You can refine it down to basic concepts and apply those.

(followup: this remains useful for more subtle stereo spatiality things)
