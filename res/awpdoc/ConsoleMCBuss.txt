# ConsoleMCBuss is the initial, bright take on the MCI console.

ConsoleMC is the pre-zero-day-patch of what became ConsoleMD. ConsoleMC was designed to sound like the classic MCI console, but some of my more nefarious algorithms got together and got out of control on me. Specifically, the whole thing worked except that SubTight, which I was using to put a special kind of highpass on channels and the 2-buss, threw me a curveball. It wasn't just cutting subs: it threw a huge tilt EQ on everything, and people were asking 'that's great, but isn't it kind of bright?'

It sure was. And it was delivering a fierce, hot intensity that was in line with what I'd been trying to accomplish… but not at that much of a cost! And so, ConsoleMD was out the very next day, after far too many espressos and frantic code-hackings, and I could rest, swearing that the zero-day patch of ConsoleMD counted as next Sunday's plugin and that I was going to go sleep.

But you never know… so you can still have and use ConsoleMC, as it came out. Maybe its ferocity works for some unusual project. And ConsoleMD becomes 'what I Meant to Do', one more in the list of what D might stand for (Deep, Dense, Dynamic, Devastating, Dude-that's-awesome, Desperately-hacking-on-into-the-night, or indeed Done) if it's no longer M C (i) to represent the big analog console of so many famed hit records.

Love you all, talk to you later.
