# YHighpass is soft and smooth to nasty, edgy texture-varying filtering.

See YLowpass, except it’s a highpass :) but there are several ‘one more things’, most notably an upgrade to what I’ve been using for denormalization. I ran into issues with YLowpass munching too much CPU. The fixes I came up with, worked so well, that I’ve applied them to Console7, Console7Cascade, Chamber, Galactic, and several plugins that haven’t come out yet :) As a result, my previous video using YLowpass crept up to 70% CPU at times, and this video using the exact same setup and plugins idles around 35%. I call that a good day (OK, week) of work.
