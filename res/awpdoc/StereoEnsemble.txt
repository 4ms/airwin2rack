# StereoEnsemble is a sort of hyperchorus blast from the past.

StereoEnsemble is a blast from the past, updated with modern dithering to floating point and undersampling: bottom line is, this is a plugin that can take either a mono or a stereo input and give you a bunch of additional ensemble-y goodness, with particular attention to simulating stereo imaging through staggered delay pairs (making stuff be panned interestingly through adding echoes that have time offsets between left and right channels).
