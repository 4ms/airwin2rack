# Distance is a sound design or reverb far-away-izer.

Here’s another utility plugin: Distance is specifically set up to mimic through-air high frequency attenuation. It’s from my initial wave of Airwindows plugins, come to VST and with a new twist: though in the video it’s a one-knobber, when you download it you’ll find that it’s got a Dry/Wet control, just to expand the things you can do with it. That’s new! I try to listen to people, even when it’s tempting to make it a super-dedicated one-trick pony.

As you can see from how it behaves, Distance is a lot more complicated than just running a shelf. For that reason, I suggest this plugin for sound design and creative mixing purposes. Don’t try to use it for mastering or 2-buss, I feel it’s too intensely colored. However, for creative use it’s exactly what it says on the tin! Stick it on anything that’s supposed to ‘read’ sonically like it’s super far away, and you’ll be able to hear for miles and miles. Works on anything from pads to thunder to basses to reverb returns (I suggest using it on reverb returns rather than sends: it will be able to add thunder and size to the output of the reverb algorithm)
