# Precious is a re-release of another old Character plugin.

So this is pretty straightforward: another Character re-issue, now free and open source and available in VST form. Woot!

Might serve as a good color-adder, or fake guitar amp? Based on Precision 8 impulses, but itâ€™s turned into very much its own thing: I think this became Holo in the Busscolors plugins. In the original form, here, you can crank up the color intensity a lot, or distort the hell out of it.
