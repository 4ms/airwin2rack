# kCathedral is a giant reverby space.

Here's a neat little experiment! As always with the K reverbs, it's a dedicated sound space with its own unique algorithm… but there are some new twists making kCathedral a step along an interesting path. This is the first of the Bricasti-inspired reverbs!

It uses a 5x5 Householder matrix, and a built-in crossover (a SubTight filter, so it's not even a normal type of filter) to allow for extra delay on the lows. The internal reverb filtering is Pear filters rather than the biquads used on the kPlates. (the reverb is undersampled at high sample rates, so the SubTight crossover will work the same whether at 1x, 2x, or 4x.)

And for all that trouble… kCathedral does NOT sound the same as the Bricasti Cathedral preset. You won't find a clone here.

But… it will produce largely the same depth and spatiality, with a different texture that is less 'rich and soft' and more 'stark and vibey'. It should be used similarly: for realism, hide it behind other sounds by keeping it quiet. There are no controls other than a dry/wet: for use on an aux, go full wet, and if you're using it inline you might end up adding just the tiniest amount (in the video, I'm using 0.03 of it on my voice, and you'll barely notice it until it switches to similarly faint ClearCoat 7, just for a sentence, after having mentioned ClearCoat.)

My hope for these is distinctness, and kCathedral might not be the one to reach for as an 'all-purpose' reverb, because it's just a first steo into a larger, more echoey new world. The thing I like about it is, while it has a distinct sound, the spatiality sits in the mix roughly the same way a real Bricasti might, even while the texture is different (will be interesting to see if I can get closer to that butter tone, in future).

All in all, a good day at work (okay, months) and I hope you enjoy kCathedral :)
