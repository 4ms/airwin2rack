# Apicolypse is a re-release of my old API-style color adder, exacly as it was.

Apicolypse works the same way Neverland did. It’s a drop-in replacement for old mixes, and was a precursor to BussColors. It’s got a simpler method of generating its dynamic impulses, making them a sort of continuous spectrum between the low-level and high-level sounds. Like Neverland, it’s 44.1K though it will still function at any rate you like (sort of pitched up): like Neverland, it’s got a hardness control that at 0 is the ‘Density’ algorithm, at 1.0 is straight digital clipping at the extreme, and at any setting between is a sort of hybrid that turned out to not be the greatest: a switch from perfectly clean, to soft-clip at any desired transition point. Technically if you had it so it only kicked in on hot peaks, it’d be hard to find fault with it: I don’t recommend setting it (on this or any Character plug or ‘Crystal’) to a position where soft-clip kicks in at very low level. Either do Hardness at zero, or high enough that most of the audio stays ‘un-distorted’: you can do what you like, though, I’m not the boss of you :)
