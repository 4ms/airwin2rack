# PurestSquish is an open-sounding compressor with bass bloom.

PurestSquish is a compressor, with its own sound. In the video I compare it to Pressure4, Logical4, and SurgeTide, and also show how it can be used in conjunction with SurgeTide (a real ‘sleeper’ plugin not easily understood) to produce amazingly transparent dynamics control.

I also spend some time torturing it with sine sweeps, showing how Pressure and Logical are more like ‘analog emulations’ and produce harmonics, while PurestSquish instead does a weird thing when you turn off and on signal generators. So if you’re looking for ways to say ‘this is broken forever!’ watch those parts of the video :)

If this doesn’t worry you, PurestSquish also has a bass bloom control that lets you pass subsonics or bass notes through uncompressed, to taste. If it does worry you, chalk it up to PurestSquish running simultaneous two-and-three-sample-interleaved compressors, much like Capacitor runs two-and-three-sample-interleaved filters, and use one of the other compressors I’ve put out, perhaps one of the three also featured in this video.
