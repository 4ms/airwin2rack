# Dyno is a lot like Mojo, but for intensity instead of loudness.

Dyno is similar in some ways to Mojo, but Dyno has a completely different character. Instead of loudenating, it ‘intensenates’. It’s a little bit like Remap in that way, but it’s not the same as Remap. You won’t get a volume boost out of it really, nor will it let you slam it for fatter peaks.

Instead, it brings fire and intensity to the audio and reshapes the waveform in a Mojo-like ‘evolution of Spiral’ way. Because it doesn’t take to slamming in the same way, it’s going to be a more subtle effect, but for those who got excited by Remap, this one deserves your attention.
