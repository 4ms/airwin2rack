# Fracture is a frequency multiplier/waveshaper with a soft disruption to the sound.

Fracture is straight up a West Coast wavefolder, in a plugin. My original description doesn't help explain that too much: it is a sine-based distortion that wraps around and lets you set a maximum 'fold' which becomes a hard clip. Boost into it with Drive to do more intense wavefolding, and increase Fracture to allow you to fold more times before it just clips. This also allows you to clip either at full crank, or at silence (for a different effect). Original post was simply this:

Hi! Merry Xmas to Xmas-ers. Here’s a truly freaky little wave-shaper. It’s of interest to distortion fanciers, those who make wubs and things, and anybody who might like the digital equivalent of an insane boutique stompbox that doesn’t sound like anything else.
