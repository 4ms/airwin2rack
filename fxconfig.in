# This is the file we read to configure the Airwindow FX. It has a very
# simple format. Lines starting with # are ignored. Blank lines are ignored
# All other lines are assumed to be an effect configuration. Effect
# configuration is super easy; two columns separated by a ';'. The first
# is the name of the effect and should match (including case) the
# directory name given in libs/airwindows/plugins/MacVST. The second
# is the group name for the rack menu. It can be anything you want.
# For instance `Galactic;Reverbs and Ambience` is a fine entry which
# would lead the rack selector menu to have a category called
# `Reverbs and Ambience` which contains `Galactic`. If there is no semicolon
# the effect is placed in group called 'Unclassified'. Dont use \" or
# other special things in the category please. It will break.
#
# When you update this file run `perl scripts/configure.pl` to re-parse
# and regenerate it.
